# Intermediate-Bash
Two scripts which use some more advanced features of bash/shell scripting such as loops and selection statements.

The first script essentially creates a variety of files and directories and then manipulates, displays, and deletes them over the course of the program.

The second script is an unfinished program which takes in command line arguments then performs actions based on the number and type of command line argument.
